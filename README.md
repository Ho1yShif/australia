# Taskmaster: Australia Webpages

Two delightfully absurd Australian-themed web projects:

**[Drop Bear Threat Assessment System™](drop-bear-threat.html)** - A sophisticated dashboard tracking the imminent danger of Australia's most feared predator with live threat metrics, correlation analysis, and security camera feeds.

**[Australian Phrase Prophet™](prophet.html)** - Generate authentic Australian phrases with mystical powers, featuring a reflection of the text shown upside down so Australians can read it from the land down under.
